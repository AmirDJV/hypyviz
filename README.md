# hypyviz
> Python Visualisation for Hyperscanning EEG

Guillaume Dumas & Amir Djalovski

## Roadmap
1️⃣ Hack the [MNE Python](https://mne.tools/) function [plot_alignment](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/blob/master/mne/viz/_3d.py#L517)) function to plot 2 heads.

2️⃣ Understand how to draw an arc from one point to another in 3D. 

Maybe the [Mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) function [plot3d](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/mlab_helper_functions.html#mayavi.mlab.plot3d) could help.

3️⃣ Combine both !

## Notes
MNE Python use also [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) as backend... it may be worse to explore!
